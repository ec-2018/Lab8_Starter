1. Option 1. Testing can become a fairly repetitive action as development goes on as, ideally, you'd like to be confident that your code is passing all/most of your test with each iteration of your code. By using Github actions testing can be done automatically, saving time while maintaining the code's functionality.  
2. No
3. No, the messaging feature likely involves a lot of interacting systems to function. For example sending a message and receiving a message requires two very different bodies of code that need to be able to function together. The entire messaging feature cannot be broken down into a single 'unit' to test. 
4. Yes probably, checking the length of an input is a self contained problem and it's unlikely to encroach on other areas of the application.
